<p> <strong> Jacques Cousteau was born on June 11, 1910, in Saint-Andr√©-de-Cubzac, France. He died from a heart attack on June 25, 1997, in Paris, France. He was a renowned marine biologist and inventor. Through the underwater film he was able to show the world something they had never seen before. He pioneered the technology of the Aqua Lung. A device that allows scuba divers to stay underwater for a very long time by providing them with oxygen from a tank. He inspired many to help preserve the ocean. His legacy is still important to this day. </strong> <p/>

<p> <strong> Jacque Cousteau was one of the first people to start advocating for the preservation of oceans and marine environments which inspired my passion for conservation. I believe our oceans (and the rest of the world) should all be protected for future generations. My love for the oceans comes from studying Jacque. I love everything to do with the ocean, surfing, fishing, sailing, swimming, tide-pooling, and just being on the beach. He inspired me to help make the world a better place. </strong> </p>
